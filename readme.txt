Getting Started (lab computers in Ullrich):
1. Clone or download repo
2. Open main_window.py, A_Star.py, Best_First.py, and Breadth_First.py in Spyder 
  (pre-installed python interpreter on all Ullrich lab computers)
3. Click green play button in top ribbon bar
4. To launch GUI, open the main_window.py script and press the green play button 
  in top ribbon bar. Use default options in popup and press 'Run'. The GUI will pop 
  up in a separate window (It usually hides behind the IDE, so look there for the pop-up window)
5. To test individual algorithms on the command line interface, open the specified algorithm and 
  uncomment the two lines at the bottom of the page.
6. If there are any runtime errors, make sure that the PyQt5 package is installed on the Python 
  executable (Python 3 and above). I prefer to use PIP installer, but this can also be achieved with Anaconda which is 
  installed on all lab computers.
